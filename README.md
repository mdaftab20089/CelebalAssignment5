# üè† Ames Housing Price Prediction Project

This project aims to **predict home sale prices** using the [Ames Housing dataset](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf), which provides comprehensive data describing the sale of individual residential properties in Ames, Iowa.

## üìÅ Project Overview

The project covers the complete machine learning pipeline:

‚úÖ Data Preprocessing  
‚úÖ Missing Value Imputation  
‚úÖ Feature Engineering  
‚úÖ Categorical Encoding  
‚úÖ Feature Scaling  
‚úÖ Data Alignment between Training and Test Sets

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During EDA, we:

- Inspected all **81 variables** in the dataset.
- Identified columns with **significant missing values**, such as:
  - `PoolQC`, `MiscFeature`, `Alley`, `Fence`, `FireplaceQu`
- Reviewed **distributions of numeric features** (e.g., `LotArea`, `GrLivArea`) and detected skewness.
- Examined **categorical features** and their frequency distributions (e.g., `Neighborhood`, `MSZoning`).
- Verified **relationships with SalePrice**, noting especially:
  - `OverallQual` and `GrLivArea` are strong predictors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing Values

**Categorical features with many missing values:**
- Filled with `'None'`:
  - `PoolQC`, `MiscFeature`, `Alley`, `Fence`, `FireplaceQu`

**Numerical features:**
- `LotFrontage`: Filled with median.
- `MasVnrArea`: Filled with `0`.
- `GarageYrBlt`: Filled with `YearBuilt`.

**Basement & Garage categorical variables:**
- Filled with `'None'`.

**Other categorical features:**
- Filled with the **mode**.

**Additional missing values in test data:**
- `MSZoning`, `Utilities`, `Exterior1st`, `Exterior2nd`, `KitchenQual`, `Functional`, `SaleType`: Filled with mode.
- `Bsmt*` and `Garage*` numeric fields: Filled with `0`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

We created **new derived features** to capture more predictive signals:

| New Feature         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `HouseAge`          | Year sold minus year built |
| `GarageAge`         | Year sold minus garage year built |
| `Remodeled`         | Binary flag if remodeled |
| `TotalBath`         | Total number of bathrooms (including basement) |
| `TotalPorchSF`      | Sum of all porch areas |
| `HasPool`           | Binary flag for presence of a pool |
| `HasFireplace`      | Binary flag for fireplaces |
| `HasGarage`         | Binary flag for garage presence |

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Encoding Categorical Variables

**Ordinal Encoding:**
- Mapped quality ratings (`ExterQual`, `KitchenQual`, `HeatingQC`, etc.) to numeric scale (0-5).

**One-Hot Encoding:**
- Applied to nominal categorical columns such as:
  - `MSZoning`, `Neighborhood`, `BldgType`, `HouseStyle`, `SaleCondition`
- Used `pd.get_dummies()` with `drop_first=True`.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Scaling

**Standardization:**
- Numeric features were standardized using `StandardScaler` (mean = 0, std = 1).
- Applied **the same scaler trained on the training data** to transform the test set.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Alignment

- After encoding, we aligned test data columns to match training data:
  - Added missing columns with zeros.
  - Ensured all features had identical structure.
- Final Shapes:
  - **Train:** 1460 rows √ó 209 columns (includes `SalePrice`)
  - **Test:** 1459 rows √ó 208 columns
